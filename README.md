# PyCitySchools
This challenge has us as the Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, and we'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. To do this we create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.
