# pandas-challenge
## Background
This challenge has us as the Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, and we'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. To do this we create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.
## Method
First we will aggregate every student's math and reading scores with the various information on the schools they attend. Then we will analyze the district-wide standardized test results by grade,  and showcase trends in school performance.
